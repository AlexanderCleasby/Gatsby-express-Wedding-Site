# Configurable Wedding/Event Site

This site is a configuarable wedding site made for my upcoming wedding.  The site is served quickly as a static site compiled with Gatsby, using React for some rich UI experinces where warrented and using a Mongo DB API for handling guest's RSVP interactions.  I built the site to be easily configurable using a few slight tweaks and I hope that I or someone else can find a use for it in the future.

## Installation
